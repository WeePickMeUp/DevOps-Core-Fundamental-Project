# DevOps Core Fundamental Project
- I created a Shopping List App which allows you to input a product you want, input which group it belongs too (like Dairy or Healthcare or Protein), edit whether or not you have or haven't picked it up yet and the ability remove it from your list entirely. 

# Requirements
- A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project. It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.

- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a relationship.

- Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

- A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on your Kanban Board.

- Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

- A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.

- Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

- I used everything I've learnt from Dara Oladapo and QA Community to contribue to my code. 

- I used a startup script in my Linux VM to pre-install VS Code and worked directly on my instance through Remote Desktop connection. This was given to me by a peer. Unfortunately I don't have a direct link to the repository he stored the script in but the script is located in startup.bash

- I used Stack Overflow for general error queries through my coding: https://stackoverflow.com/

- For Pytest help I used these YouTube videos: https://youtu.be/7BJ_BKeeJyM | https://youtu.be/bbp_849-RZ4

- For Python help I also needed some support from:
https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp

- For HTML help I also needed some support from:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

- To get a better understanding of project structure and CRUD fundamentals I used: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one | https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-crud-application-with-flask-and-sqlalchemy-dm3wv7yu2

- I also used a Live Tutorial on YouTube to understand the design process of a CRUD app and what you can do in HTML:

- To build a base for my app and understand what each line of code does I used a Todo app tutorial:
